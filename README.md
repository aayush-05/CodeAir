CodeAir is a peer-peer real time code collaboration/code-pairing platform along with text messaging and audio-connectivity. 
It offers the same experience as writing code in a google-doc on a video call with much-less bandwidth requirements and
a more focussed user-interface.

With no login/sign-up hassle and round trips to a database server (inhibiting your privacy); this is the fastest you can spin a server 
and get on with a code-pairing session.

## Technologies Involved
CodeAir is running on the top of following technologies:
- React
- NodeJS (Express)
- WebRTC
- Socket.io
